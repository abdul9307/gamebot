    "rules": "Players take turns placing their pieces on a board. Each piece played must be put next to an opponent's piece so that the opponent's piece (or a row of opponent's pieces) is flanked by the new piece and another piece of the player's color. All of the opponent's pieces between these two pieces are 'captured' and turned over to match the player's color. The game is over when neither player has a legal move (i.e. a move that captures at least one opposing piece) or when the board is full.",
