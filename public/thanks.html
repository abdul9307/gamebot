                    As websites like rabb.it shut down, spending time with people remotely became harder. Staying connected to people you care about—even if it's as simple as playing a game with them—really matters. I made Gamebot to bridge the distance between friends, whether it was to bring people together from across the coffee table or from across the world. Thank you for supporting this bot and helping towards this mission.
